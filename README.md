# Multimarginal Martingale Optimal Transport

This code implements dual optimization of MMOT based on the framework of Eckstein, Kupper (2019) and developed upon Python/Pytorch. It allows the analysis of performance improvements from monotone coupling based on the theoretical results from the reference research project.

Reference research project: Hiew, Lim, Pass, Souza "Modularity, Convex conjugates and MMOT" (in development).
