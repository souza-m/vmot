# Vectorial Martingale Optimal Transport (VMOT)

This repository contains the numerical implementation for the research paper **"Geometry of vectorial martingale optimal transport and robust option pricing"** by Hiew, Lim, Pass, and Souza (2023). The project focuses on solving the **Vectorial Martingale Optimal Transport (VMOT)** problem with applications in robust finance, particularly in robust option pricing.

## Abstract
Robust finance is concerned with developing models and approaches that account for market uncertainties. This research investigates the VMOT problem, the geometry of its solutions, and its application to robust option pricing problems in finance. We consider two-period market models and demonstrate that when the spatial dimension \(d\) (the number of underlying assets) is 2, the extremal model for the cap option with a sub- or super-modular payout reduces to a single-factor model in the first period. However, this dimensional reduction does not generally hold for \(d > 2\). Our results highlight the intricate relationship between spatial dimension, cost function supermodularity, and their impact on the geometry of VMOT solutions. We further explore computational applications of the model and show how monotonicity-induced dimensional reduction can enhance existing computational methods.

## Features
- **Dual Problem Computation**: Implements the dual formulation of the VMOT problem using the framework established by Eckstein and Kupper (2021).
- **Dimensional Reduction**: Exploits a dimensional reduction technique in some cases, enabled by a monotonicity property, as described in the research paper.
- **Neural Network Optimization**: Uses **Adam gradient descent optimizer** through Python's PyTorch library  for neural network implementation.
- **Numerical Experiments**: Provides scripts for reproducing results from the paper, including robust option pricing problems in two-period market models.
