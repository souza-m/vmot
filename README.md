# Vectorial Martingale Optimal Transport

This is the numerical implementation of Hiew, Lim, Pass and Souza (2023) "Geometry of vectorial martingale optimal transport and robust option pricing" - https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04947. It computes the dual optimization of VMOT based on the framework of Eckstein, Kupper (2019) and developed upon Python/Pytorch. It allows the analysis of performance improvements from monotone coupling based on the theoretical results from the reference research project.
